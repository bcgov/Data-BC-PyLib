# DataBC Python Library

This folder contains a bunch of python packages that tie together higher level functionality.  
The code here is used by multiple automation processes and is intended to make it easier to automate various tasks in support of databc's business.  

I'm gradually working towards documentation of the more heavily used modules in the 'docs' folder.

You should see some examples there for the:
- FMEServer Rest API wrapper and PMP module
- Secrets module.
